## Previewing

TODO: expand and clarify

There are two preview features. One lets you share previews with unauthenticated users. The other is preview for authenticated users.

Sometimes the preview for unauthenticated users can get stuck or cached. The way to get it to uncache is to uncheck the preview box and then check it again.

## Publication Time

Jason's favorite time is 8:30 AM Pacific Time. Before lunch on East Coast, but late enough to be what people on West Coast see it first thing when they arrive in office.

## Comments & Pingbacks

We don’t have a formal policy on comment approval, but here’s Jason's general guideline:

- Let the author approve comments so they have the opportunity to process and respond if they want to.
- Replying to comments is up to the author. If they contribute to understanding and there is nothing else to add, don’t feel compelled to respond.
- Delete comments that are spam, troll, or jerk-like behavior.

### Advice from Jason:

> Despite the fact that we ask people to be kind, courteous and constructive when they submit comments on our site, when articles reach a larger audience, we will inevitably end up some with comments that start to inch into an unkind territory. It can be hard to tell how to respond. If they are blatant jerks, I’ll simply delete their comment—you don’t get to come into our house and tear the place up.

> Sometimes with a comment [like this one](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/an-html-attribute-potentially-worth-4-4m-to-chipotle/#comment-5880), I’ll decide to ignore the sarcasm and treat the question seriously. [Here's another example](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/first-thing-you-should-do-to-optimize-your-desktop-site-for-mobile/#comment-690).

### Pingbacks

Don't approve pingbacks. We keep the featured enabled so we can see if websites link to us, but there's not very much review in displaying them on the site, and we don't optimize for them in our design.

## Translation Requests

We have received requests to translate our articles in the past, but don't have a set answer. We'll considering saying "yes," if we still get credit, a link back to our site is clearly included, and they have a demonstrable track record of respectful translations.

## Writing Advice

[Don't Feel Like an Expert? Share Anyway.](https://medium.com/@sara_ann_marie/dont-feel-like-an-expert-share-anyway-661f2f8cd038)

> Too many of the most interesting voices in tech and design talk themselves out of writing or speaking about their work—because they don’t think they have enough experience. But you don’t have to wait for “enough“ (whatever that means). Here’s how to find what’s special about your perspective right now—wherever you are in your career.

[Advice for Technical Writing](https://css-tricks.com/advice-for-technical-writing/)

> In advance of a recent podcast with the incredible technical writer and Smashing Magazine editor-in-chief Rachel Andrew, I gathered up a bunch of thoughts and references on the subject of technical writing. So many smart people have said a lot of smart things over the years that I thought I'd round up some of my favorite advice and sprinkle in my own experiences, as someone who has also done his fair share of technical writing and editing.

[Avoid the Word "Just"](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/just/)

> “Just” makes me feel like an idiot. “Just” presumes I come from a specific background, studied certain courses in university, am fluent in certain technologies, and have read all the right books, articles, and resources. “Just” is a dangerous word.

[Keep Code Samples Short & Relevant](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1106631555693187073)

> When writing technical blog posts, please take care that the code samples in the article aren't long. In my opinion, the post shouldn't be the full repo. Highlight the specific parts of interest, and peel away boilerplate so people can read less and learn more. Then, if needed, link to a more complete code example on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/), or something similar.

[Write a Hulk Summary](https://chriscoyier.net/2020/01/23/the-hulk-summary/)

> Channel your inner Hulk voice and use it to describe whatever you need to get writing on. Hammer down that shift key (caps lock is a cop-out) and type max 4 words for each bullet to capture the core sentiment of what you’re arguing.

> WRITING IS HARD; YOU THINK TOO MUCH! WE HAVE A SOLUTION; THE HULK SUMMARY!
