# Learning JavaScript

*Note*: Right now this is just a catch-all place for some JavaScript learning resources and scribbly notes. I may continue to organize this more formally as we go.

# JavaScript, Introduction

Read the [Introduction chapter of _Eloquent JavaScript_](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html).

## *What is JavaScript?* and Terminology

### ECMA

The chapter makes mention of ECMA and ECMAScript. These are terms you’ll hear a lot. Developers often abbreviate “ECMAScript”  to _ES_, as in _ES5_ and _ES6_ (both in written and spoken forms).

ES6 (ECMAScript 6, also known as “Harmony”) is a big, hot topic right now. We’ll be talking more about that as we go.

For now, most of what you’ll see is ES5, the flavor of JavaScript supported by [basically every browser](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/).

### Platforms and Engines

JavaScript is a language, but it needs a place to be executed. There are several leading JavaScript engines

## Questions for Thought

* Is there a difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript? Why do both exist?
* What's the relationship between JavaScript and node?
