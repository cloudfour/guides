I learned today that you can link to a multiple-line selection, not just a single line, e.g. https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/blob/master/lib/plugins/console/generate.js#L89-L101

Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` at the top of your repo and it will get linked to with a "read the guidelines for contributing..." automatically!
