# Rituals

This guide documents some common rituals we encourage in our work.

These are not ironclad processes we should always follow. More like a helpful jumping-off point if you're on a project where they would be useful.

## [Postmortems](./postmortems.md)

> “A postmortem is a written record of an incident, its impact, the actions taken to mitigate or resolve it, the root cause(s), and the follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring.” — Google's _Site Reliability Engineering_

This ritual is held when a serious incident happens, such as a site outage, and the team needs to understand what happened and how to avoid it in the future.
